                    EQ is the ability to sense, understand and effectively apply
                    the power and acumen of emotions as a source of human
                    energy, information and influence. Emotional Intelligence
                    (EQ) emerges not merely from intellectual rationalization,
                    but from the workings of the human heart. EQ requires that
                    we learn to acknowledge and value feelings in ourselves and
                    others – that we appropriately respond to them, effectively
                    applying the information and energy of emotions in our daily
                    life and work. It is Emotional Intelligence that motivates
                    us to pursue our unique potential and purpose, and activates
                    our innermost values and aspirations, transforming them from
                    things we only dream about into actual realities. It is our
                    Emotional Intelligence that helps us be inspired, ignite our
                    passions, discover our purpose, embrace change, build a
                    sense of belonging and deepen the quality of our
                    relationships with others. People with high EQ make better
                    decisions, handle stress and conflicts better, and navigate
                    social complexities more effectively.

                    Creative Thinking is the ability to produce new ideas and
                    new ways of seeing things. It is a structured thinking
                    process that includes generating new ideas and putting them
                    into action, so that they produce practical and relevant
                    outcomes. People with high creative thinking skills are able
                    to look at challenges from different angles and
                    perspectives, and are open to change, innovation and
                    improvement. They possess curiosity, the ability to see
                    connections between seemingly unrelated things, and the
                    skill to apply imagination and creativity to solve problems.
                    Creative thinkers are not afraid to take risks, learn from
                    their mistakes, and push boundaries to explore new
                    possibilities and solutions. In today's fast-changing and
                    competitive world, creative thinking is essential for
                    success in all fields.

                    Openness, Neutral, Analytical, Relational and Decisive

                    The LEONARD Personality Inventory is based on research work
                    by Dr. Leonard Yong in the last ten years and is modelled
                    after a combination of both the four Greek temperaments and
                    the Big Five Model. The approximate equivalent of the
                    LEONARD Personality Inventory to these two models are as
                    follows:

                  Results from the administrations of the LEONARD Inventory in
                  Malaysia have indicated the validity and reliability of the
                  Personality Inventory for the purpose of identifying the
                  preferred behavioural styles of respondents. Intervention
                  programs have been designed to assist individuals to enhance
                  their emotional intelligence (intra-personal and
                  inter-personal skills). This has been found to be especially
                  useful in helping organizations, which have encouraged
                  teamwork and innovative approaches to the workplace through
                  harmonious and synergistic teamwork. Other uses include
                  premarital and marital counselling.
